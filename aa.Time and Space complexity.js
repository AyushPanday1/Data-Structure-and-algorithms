/*
DSA is always practiced for making the program Time and space efficient.


Time complexity - It is the time bound that a program takes to execute and return its result.

for e.g.

Calculate the sum upto 10;

Normal approach:

let sum = 0;
for(let i=0;i<=10;i++){
    sum+=i;
}
console.log(sum)

T(C) = 0(n)



Efficient approach:

Sum = (N*(N+1))/2;

T(C) = 0(1)


It is calculated in Big-oh, Omega and theta notation.

Big-oh notation 0(n) - Worst case or uppermost bound to solve a program.

Big-Omega notation (Ω) - Best or efficient case or lowest bound.

Big-Theta (Θ) - Average case or normal bound.


====================================================================


Space complexity:

It is defined as space used by an algorithm to execute code. 
Any extra space covered by a program makes the code slow.

e.g. = 0(1)
